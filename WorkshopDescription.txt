[h1]Build 42 Unstable[/h1]
There may be bugs in the unstable version! Please report them so I can fix them as they come. Some features are incomplete and only partially re-implemented from the B41 version of the mod. The fluid system introduced a lot of changes that required a lot of alterations to the mod.

[h1]More Workout Supplements![/h1]

This mod adds more workout supplements to Project Zomboid! Unique workout shakes can be created from a full plastic water bottle or a full blender bottle. This mod is under active development! Please leave suggestions or ideas for improvements below.
